## `( o_O )?` The Problem
The internet is fragile. News articles are stealth-edited, tweets are deleted, and evidence vanishes behind "404 Not Found" errors.
*   **Link Rot:** 25% of deep-web links die within years.
*   **Censorship:** Centralized archives can be forced to take down content. 
*   **Tampering:** Screenshots can be Photoshopped. 

## `(≧∇≦)ﾉ` The Solution
**TimeCapsule** is a forensic archiving tool that freezes the truth forever.
1.  **Capture:** We use a server-side browser to take a forensic snapshot of the DOM.
2.  **Store:** We upload the content to **IPFS**, so it can never be deleted. 
3.  **Timestamp:** We anchor the SHA-256 hash to the **Bitcoin Blockchain** via OpenTimestamps.

**Result?** An immutable, verifiable record that holds up in court.

## How to Verify Evidence

Don't trust us? Verify it yourself! `( ಠ_ಠ )`

1.  Go to the **Verify Page** of any capture.
2.  Download the **Evidence File** (from IPFS) and the **Proof File** (`.ots`).
3.  Go to [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org).
4.  Upload both files.
5.  **Success!** You will see the Bitcoin Block height where your data is anchored.
